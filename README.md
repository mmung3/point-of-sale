# Point of Sale

### What is this project?

This project will run a check-out system commonly seen in
a grocery or convenience store. It will be modelled after
a **self-checkout** system (for a *customer* to use), 
although it could also be run by a *human* cashier.

### Inspiration

Having worked in retail previously, the poor design of some
systems infuriated my co-workers and I. With this project
I will explore the design of a more functional and
effective point of sale.

### User Stories
Some examples include:
- as a user, I want to add products (including bags) that are on the
catalogue to my current list of items
- as a user, I want to remove products that I no longer
wish to purchase
- as a user, I want to see my amount of change calculated
correctly based on a cash amount I will give
- as a user, I want to enter a validly formatted card
number and PIN to complete the purchase
- as a user, I want to be able to save my entire list of items
so that, if I wanted, I could come back with more items, or
come back with a different or new payment method 
(*for example, I left my wallet in the car, 
or I need to go grab an extra can of beans
all the day down in aisle 15*). 
- as a user, I want to be able to enter my shopper ID and
have the in-progress purchase associated with my account
made active again.
