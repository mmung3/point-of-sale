# Minesweeper

### What is this project?
This project will encompass a program capable of running 
the game **Minesweeper**, similar to the one commonly 
seen on old *Windows XP* (or even older versions) devices.
The completed project will allow any user to be able to 
play the game as they desire. 

### Inspiration

Since playing the game as a kid, I was always
curious as to how the computer was able to generate and
run the game in the way it did. This project will allow me
to explore the construction and process, behind the scenes.

### User Stories
Some examples include:
- As a user, I wish to see safe tiles uncovered upon my input 
(ex. by mouse press or grid selection)
- As a user, I wish to add as many flags as I want
placed onto the tile(s) of my choosing
- As a user, I want to see the game end if I select a mine
- As a user, I want to see the game state saved whenever I 
may decide to save my progress
